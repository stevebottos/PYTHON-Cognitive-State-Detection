# PYTHON-Cognitive-State-Detection
An identical implementation of MATLAB-Cognitive-State-Detection's Neural Network, for comparison. This repository does not include the data cleaning steps, since that portion was written in Matlab and can be found in that repository. 

## A Quick Note

This repo is a bit sparse, for full context and a full description, please check out the main codebase (the Matlab implementation). The main purpose of this repo is to provide code that is intended to assist anybody making the transition from Matlab to Python. There were a lot of requests from friends to give an example on how to write a Neural Network in Python. I plan to also upload a Tensorflow example. 

This repo contains the code for the Neural Net as well as the data used to train and test.
