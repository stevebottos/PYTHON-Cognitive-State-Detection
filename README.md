# PYTHON-Cognitive-State-Detection
An identical implementation of MATLAB-Cognitive-State-Detection's Neural Network, for comparison. This repository does not include the data cleaning steps, since that portion was written in Matlab and can be found in that repository. 

## A Quick Note

This repo is a bit sparse, for full context and a full description, please check out the main codebase (the Matlab implementation). The main purpose of this repo is to provide code that is intended to assist anybody making the transition from Matlab to Python, and to showcase how a Neural Network may be implemented from scratch in Python with mostly home made functions. There were a lot of requests from friends to give an example on how to write a Neural Network in Python. I plan to also upload a Tensorflow example. Prediction accuracies were more or less the same as those given in **MatlabResults** in the Matlab implementation's repo, so they are not shown here at the moment.

Please message me to request the train/test data if you wish to run this code using my inputs.
